        <p>Varisu (/vɑːrɪsu/ transl. Heir) is a 2023 Indian Tamil-language action drama film directed by Vamshi Paidipally who co-wrote it with Hari and Ashishor Solomon. Produced jointly by Dil Raju and Sirish under the banner of Sri Venkateswara Creations and PVP Cinema, the film stars Vijay and Rashmika Mandanna, with an ensemble cast of R. Sarathkumar, Prabhu, Jayasudha, Prakash Raj, Srikanth, Shaam, Ganesh Venkatraman, Sangeetha Krish, VTV Ganesh, S.J Suryah and Suman in other pivotal roles. It focuses on an entrepreneur's youngest son being named the chairman of his father's business, much to the dismay of his two brothers.

The film was announced in September 2021 under the tentative title Thalapathy 66, as it is Vijay's 66th film in a leading role. Principal photography began in April 2022 and concluded in December. The film was shot mostly in Chennai and Hyderabad, with sporadic schedules in Visakhapatnam, Ballari and Ladakh. The music was composed by Thaman S, cinematography handled by Karthik Palani and editing was by Praveen K. L. The film was subject to numerous leaks during production, despite the efforts of the producers to contain them.

Varisu was released in theatres worldwide on 11 January 2023, in the week of Pongal, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film has grossed around ₹290–310 crore at the box office,[b] making it currently the fourth highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, one of the highest-grossing Tamil films worldwide as well as the highest grosser in Vijay's career.

Plot
Vijay Rajendran, the youngest son of an eminent billionaire business magnate, Rajendran Palanisamy, is disowned and thrown out of the house as he refused to join the family business, instead deciding to launch a food delivery startup. Seven years later, Rajendran is diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer with only 8-10 months to live. He decides to reveal his terminal condition and anoint one of his two elder sons, Jai or Ajay, as his successor, before his impending death. With this in mind, Rajendran plans to celebrate his 65th birthday grandly, intending to announce both matters during the celebration. Vijay gets invited at the behest of his mother, Sudha, who still considers him her son.

Vijay arrives only to find his house in disarray. Jai is cheating on his wife, Aarthi, with another woman Smita, and neglecting his family, in the process, including his daughter Ria. Ajay owes over 500 crore rupees to Mukesh, a financier. When he could not repay the money, he offered to leak his company's secrets to his father's business rival, Jayaprakash "JP". The two elder brothers do not speak with each other and constantly fight to be their father's successor.

Meanwhile, Vijay meets Divya, Aarthi's younger sister, who has had a crush on Vijay since childhood. After a few incidents, the duo fall for each other. During Rajendran's birthday celebration, JP, through Smita and Mukesh, reveals the duplicity of Jai and Ajay, which devastates the entire family, particularly Aarthi, who decides to file for divorce from Jai, as well as Rajendran, who has lost a business deal to JP due to Ajay's duplicity. Realising that he cannot rely on his elder sons to run his business empire, Rajendran reaches out to Vijay, who initially refuses, but later agrees to take over the business after learning about Rajendran's illness.

Jai and Ajay leave the house in jealousy and dismay and join hands with JP and Mukesh to get rid of Vijay as the chairman, but Vijay manages to cross the hurdles and neatly handles the family business. But after Vijay rescues Ria from a human trafficking gang, Jai realises his mistakes and reconciles with Vijay, Aarthi, and the rest of the family. Vijay and Jai then team up to stop Ajay from selling their company's shares to JP and make him realise his mistakes. The entire family, now reunited, have a hearty meal together, much to the happiness of Rajendran and Sudha. When Rajendran dies, the three brothers perform his funeral together and scatter his ashes in Varanasi. The film ends with a message that no family is perfect, but everyone has only one family.

Development
On 26 September 2021, Vijay's 66th film as lead actor was announced with the working title Thalapathy 66. Directed by Vamshi Paidipally, it is the first Tamil film produced by Dil Raju and Sirish under Sri Venkateswara Creations,[10][11] and Paidipally's second Tamil film after Thozha (2016).[12] Paidipally said the makers initially intended to announce the project early that year, but had to postpone their plans due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India.[13] Vijay was reported to receive a payment of ₹110 crore (US$14 million) for the film.[14] He was also reported to be sporting two looks as the film would be set in two different time periods.[15]

Paidipally wrote the story and screenplay along with Hari and Ashishor Solomon.[11] Raju Murugan was signed as the dialogue writer but he opted out of the project due to other film commitments.[16][17] Murugan was replaced by Vivek for additional screenplay and dialogues.[11] Cinematographer Karthik Palani, editor Praveen K. L. and production designers Sunil Babu and Vaishnavi Reddy, were part of the film's technical crew.[18] Dil Raju described the film as "family-centric" like most of Vijay's films from the 1990s.[19] While several reports anticipated the film to be a Tamil-Telugu bilingual, the makers clarified that the film would be shot only in Tamil.[20][21] The title Varisu was announced on 21 June 2022, the eve of Vijay's 48th birthday.[22]

In an interview with Ananda Vikatan, Vamshi claimed that the film is a family entertainer in the baseline and not specific to the genre, as he felt necessary to include several elements that would cater to the target audience, especially while writing for a big star like Vijay. He did the same, keeping in mind with the star and his image, which he felt that every section of the audience — including children and seniors — would enjoy the film.[23][24]

Casting
The story for the film was written keeping Mahesh Babu in mind and when the actor could not sign up for the film, the makers approached Allu Arjun, Prabhas and Ram Charan before finalising Vijay.[25] In October 2021, Prakash Raj was reported to play a key role in the film, collaborating with Vijay after over a decade since Villu (2009).[26][27] On 5 April 2022, the birthday of Rashmika Mandanna, it was announced that she would be the lead actress.[28] It is her second Tamil film after Sulthan (2021).[29] The makers initially wanted Pooja Hegde as the lead actress, but ultimately desisted since she was doing consecutive films with stars; Hegde had previously starred with Vijay in Beast (2022).[30] R. Sarathkumar joined the cast the day after Mandanna's announcement.[31]

On 26 April 2022, Shaam confirmed being a part of the film,[32] and the following week, Yogi Babu also confirmed his presence in the film.[33] Five days later, the production house confirmed Prabhu and Jayasudha as part of the cast,[34] and two days later, Telugu actor Srikanth,[35] Sangeetha Krish and Samyuktha Shanmughanathan.[36] In early June, a photograph of Khushbu on the sets was leaked.[37] Though she initially denied being part of the cast,[38] her presence was confirmed on 26 October.[39] According to Vijay, her role was minor.[40]: 9:40  Khushbu's scenes were excluded from the theatrical cut due to length issues.[41] On 23 August, Ganesh Venkatraman confirmed his presence in the film.[42] In September, Sriman was confirmed to be a part of the film.[43] At the film's audio launch on 24 December, Vijay announced that S. J. Suryah would play a minor role, which he accepted for Vijay's sake.[40]: 9:45–10:20 

Filming
The inaugural puja ceremony for the film's shooting was held on 6 April 2022 in Chennai, and was followed by filming of the first schedule.[44] It took place at a specially constructed set at a film city in East Coast Road, Chennai and was completed on 15 April.[45][46] Initially, 75% of the shoot was planned to take place in Hyderabad but Vijay requested the production to remain in Chennai to benefit the local FEFSI members, and the makers reportedly agreed.[47] Despite this, the Hyderabad schedule began on 3 May,[48] and concluded by 23 May.[49] The Chennai schedule resumed on 3 June, with the recurring portions also being shot at the film city. This includes a song sequence and few talkie portions.[50] Despite stringent measures taken by the production team, pictures taken from the sets were leaked onto the internet and by 15 June, the team planned to shift the shooting location to a private spot, resulting in the halt of filming.[51] By 23 June 45% of filming was over, with another schedule to begin in July.[52] The fourth schedule began on 5 July in Hyderabad,[53] and completed within three weeks.[54]

The team headed to Visakhapatnam for the fifth schedule in late-July; Paidipally planned to shoot the film in live locations in the city, and the details of the venue were undisclosed, in order to avoid fans gathering.[55] Despite the Telugu Film Producers Guild's (TFPG) decision to halt shootings of Telugu films from 1 August 2022, Dil Raju, the head of TFPG, assured that the shooting of Varisu would continue as it was a Tamil-language film and not a bilingual.[56][57] During the production in Hyderabad, several stills from the film were leaked, and fans criticised the carelessness of the production house.[58] In mid-August 2022, a song shoot was held featuring Vijay and Mandanna, and is choreographed by Jani Master.[59] The team moved to Hyderabad for filming another song, with the lead pair and choreographer in September.[60]

The final schedule commenced on 25 September, with two fight sequences and two songs left to be shot in this schedule.[61] The filming was completed on 27 October 2022,[62] except for patchwork sequences and a final song, which was shot from 14 to 19 November in Bellary.[63] It was followed by the ongoing shooting of the climax sequences in Hyderabad, taking place for nearly 10 days.[64] During the schedule, a reporter and his team flew drone camera over the shooting location, but was seized by the fans, preventing the reporter from getting footage from the sets.[65] Post-production for the film went simultaneously in mid-November, and full-fledged post-production works would begin by December, once filming is wrapped. The technical team also travelled to Ladakh to capture montage sequences.[64] Filming was completed in December</p>
